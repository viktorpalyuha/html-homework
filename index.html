			<h1> About </h1>
			<p>Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove
				that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better,
				quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla builds not only all-electric
				vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Tesla believes the
				faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.
				Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain.
				From there, Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up –
				Model S – which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance,
				and efficiency, Model S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the
				longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and
				a record
				0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its
				product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that
				holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety
				Administration.
				Completing CEO Elon Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a low-priced,
				high-volume
				electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most comfortable
				truck
				ever – Tesla Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on
				fuel costs alone.</p>
